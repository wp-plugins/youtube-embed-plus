YouTube embed plugin for WordPress. Provides the basic features of YouTube for your blog, and convenient defaults.

== Description ==

This YouTube embed plugin for WordPress is very simple.  It provides the basic features of YouTube, and will have you embedding in seconds after installing it.  If you want to explore a more advanced plugin, we suggest looking at another one like: [Advanced YouTube Embed](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/embedplus-for-wordpress/) by [EmbedPlus](http://www.embedplus.com). 

To start using this plugin, simply paste a YouTube link on its own line. You can also make default settings for all your YouTube videos under the YouTube admin menu. You can make additional YouTube embed customizations by adding more to the link as shown below: 

* width - Sets the width of your player. If omitted, the default width will be the width of your theme's content. Example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&width=500&height=350
* height - Sets the height of your player. If omitted, this will be calculated for you automatically. Example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&width=500&height=350
* autoplay - Set this to 1 to autoplay the video (or 0 to play the video once). Example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&autoplay=1
* cc_load_policy - Set this to 1 to turn on closed captioning (or 0 to leave them off). Example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&cc_load_policy=1
* iv_load_policy - Set this to 3 to turn off annotations (or 1 to show them). Example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&iv_load_policy=3
* loop - Set this to 1 to loop the video (or 0 to not loop). Example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&loop=1
* modestbranding - Set this to 1 to remove the YouTube logo while playing (or 0 to show the logo). Example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&modestbranding=1
* rel - Set this to 0 to not show related videos at the end of playing (or 1 to show them). Example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&rel=0
* showinfo - Set this to 0 to hide the video title and other info (or 1 to show it). Example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&showinfo=0
* theme - Set this to 'light' to make the player have the light-colored theme (or 'dark' for the dark theme). Example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&theme=light
