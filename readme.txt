YouTube embed plugin with basic features and convenient defaults. Upgrade now to add view tracking and access to your very own analytics dashboard.

== Description ==

This YouTube embed plugin for WordPress is very simple.  It provides the basic features of the YouTube embedded player, and will have you posting videos in seconds after installing it. Version 2.0 and after adds view tracking to each embed so that you can gain access to your very own YouTube analytics dashboard. Upgrade if you'd like the feature and get answers to questions like:

* How much are your visitors actually watching the videos you post?
* How does the view activity on your site compare to other sites like it?
* What and when are your best and worst performers?
* How much do the producers of the YouTube videos you embed rely on **your site** for views?

If you want to explore a more advanced plugin, we suggest looking at another one like: [Advanced YouTube Embed](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/embedplus-for-wordpress/) by [EmbedPlus](http://www.embedplus.com). 

To start using this plugin, simply paste a YouTube link on its own line. You can also make default settings for all your YouTube videos under the YouTube admin menu. You can make additional YouTube embed customizations by adding more to the link as shown below: 

* width - Sets the width of your player. If omitted, the default width will be the width of your theme's content. Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&width=500&height=350`
* height - Sets the height of your player. If omitted, this will be calculated for you automatically. Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&width=500&height=350`
* autoplay - Set this to 1 to autoplay the video (or 0 to play the video once). Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&autoplay=1`
* cc_load_policy - Set this to 1 to turn on closed captioning (or 0 to leave them off). Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&cc_load_policy=1`
* iv_load_policy - Set this to 3 to turn off annotations (or 1 to show them). Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&iv_load_policy=3`
* loop - Set this to 1 to loop the video (or 0 to not loop). Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&loop=1`
* modestbranding - Set this to 1 to remove the YouTube logo while playing (or 0 to show the logo). Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&modestbranding=1`
* rel - Set this to 0 to not show related videos at the end of playing (or 1 to show them). Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&rel=0`
* showinfo - Set this to 0 to hide the video title and other info (or 1 to show it). Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&showinfo=0`
* theme - Set this to 'light' to make the player have the light-colored theme (or 'dark' for the dark theme). Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&theme=light`

== Changelog ==

= YouTube Embed 2.1 =
By request from several users, we've added easier access to the video analytics dashboard

= YouTube Embed 2.0 =

This upgrade specifically integrates a user-friendly YouTube Analytics Dashboard to this plugin so you can learn a lot more about the videos you post.  Download it if you would like it to use your site's YouTube-related activity to help answer questions like:
 
* How much are your visitors actually watching the videos you post?
* How does the view activity on your site compare to other sites like it?
* What and when are your best and worst performers?
* How much do the producers of the YouTube videos you embed rely on **your site** for views?

We think these are all interesting questions; however, note that there's no need to upgrade if you don't.  

= YouTube Embed 1.1 =
Fixed minor bug.

= YouTube Embed 1.0 =
First release uploaded to the plugin repository.

== Other Notes ==

Again, note that this is a no-frills plugin. We're just supporting the basic functions that people typically want when embedding YouTube videos. This includes [YouTube embed analytics](https://www.embedplus.com/dashboard/wordpress-video-analytics-seo.aspx) to help you learn a lot about the videos you post.
