This plugin helps you easily manage the growing complexity of YouTube embedding. It provides a spectrum of basic and advanced features of the YouTube embedded player and will have you posting videos in seconds after installing it. **All you have to do is simply paste an unformatted YouTube link on its own line (shortcodes are also supported).** Your YouTube embeds will then show up when you preview or publish the post.

The settings page has plenty of default options that you can automatically apply to all your embedded YouTube videos. **Check out the free options below:**

* Force HD quality when available
* Make your videos responsive so that they dynamically fit in all screen sizes (smart phone, PC and tablet)
* Modest branding - hide YouTube logo while playing
* Turn on/off all annotations by default
* Automatically center all your videos
* Automatically start playing your videos
* Autohide controls until hovering
* Loop your videos
* Show/hide related videos at the end
* Show/hide the video title and other info
* Use the light theme
* Show/hide player controls
* Turn on/off closed captions by default
* Use "opaque" wmode

Customizations can be also made to each YouTube embed by adding more to the link as shown below. Adding these will override the above global defaults that you set:

* width - Sets the width of your player. If omitted, the default width will be the width of your theme's content. Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&width=500&height=350`
* height - Sets the height of your player. If omitted, this will be calculated for you automatically. Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&width=500&height=350`
* vq - Set this to `hd720` or `hd1080` to force the video to play in HD quality, if available. Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&vq=hd720`
* autoplay - Set this to 1 to autoplay the video (or 0 to play the video once). Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&autoplay=1`
* cc_load_policy - Set this to 1 to turn on closed captioning (or 0 to leave them off). Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&cc_load_policy=1`
* iv_load_policy - Set this to 3 to turn off annotations (or 1 to show them). Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&iv_load_policy=3`
* loop - Set this to 1 to loop the video (or 0 to not loop). Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&loop=1`
* modestbranding - Set this to 1 to remove the YouTube logo while playing (or 0 to show the logo). Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&modestbranding=1`
* rel - Set this to 0 to not show related videos at the end of playing (or 1 to show them). Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&rel=0`
* showinfo - Set this to 0 to hide the video title and other info (or 1 to show it). Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&showinfo=0`
* theme - Set this to 'light' to make the player have the light-colored theme (or 'dark' for the dark theme). Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&theme=light`
* autohide - Set this to 1 to slide away the control bar after the video starts playing. It will automatically slide back in again if you mouse over the video. (Set to  2 to always show it). Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&autohide=1`

You can also start and end each individual video at particular times. Like the above, each option should begin with '&'

* start - Sets the time (in seconds) to start the video. Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&width=500&height=350&start=20`
* end - Sets the time (in seconds) to stop the video. Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&width=500&height=350&end=100`

**About the PRO version:**

Beyond the above features, you have the option of upgrading to PRO to add enhanced features like the full visual embedding wizard (so you can avoid memorizing codes), priority support, and security/performance. As a PRO user, you also get access to our deleted video alerts to help avoid showing embedded videos that are later removed from YouTube.com. You even get an embedder-centric analytics dashboard that adds view tracking to each of your embeds so that you can answers questions like:

* How much are your visitors actually watching the videos you post?
* How does the view activity on your site compare to other sites like it?
* What and when are your best and worst performing YouTube embeds?
* How much do the producers of the YouTube videos you embed rely on **your site**, versus other sites and YouTube.com, for views?
* Are you embedding videos that are blocked in other countries?

See more details after installing. Enjoy!

== Installation ==

1. Use the WordPress plugin installer to install the plugin.  Alternatively, you can just extract the folder in our download package and upload it to your plugin directory.
1. Access the Plugins admin menu to activate the YouTube embed plugin.
1. Make your default settings after clicking the new YouTube menu item that shows up in your admin panel.
1. To embed videos in your post, start pasting the links with any desired additional codes needed for your YouTube embed (see below section for additional codes). Make sure each link is on its own line. Or, if you need multiple videos on the same line, make sure each URL is wrapped properly with the shortcode. Example: `[embedyt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABCDEFGHIJK&width=400&height=250[/embedyt]` If you don't know exactly which video you want to embed, use the free built-in search feature to find and insert one.

You can also start and end each individual video at particular times. Like the above, each option should begin with '&'

* start - Sets the time (in seconds) to start the video. Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&width=500&height=350&start=20`
* end - Sets the time (in seconds) to stop the video. Example: `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&width=500&height=350&end=100`

**Always follow these rules when pasting a link:**

* Make sure the url is really on its own line by itself. Or, if you need multiple videos on the same line, make sure each URL is wrapped properly with the shortcode. Example: `[embedyt]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABCDEFGHIJK&width=400&height=250[/embedyt]`
* Make sure the url is not an active hyperlink (i.e., it should just be plain text). Otherwise, highlight the url and click the "unlink" button in your editor.
* Make sure you did **not** format or align the url in any way. If your url still appears in your actual post instead of a video, highlight it and click the "remove formatting" button (formatting can be invisible sometimes).
* Finally, there's a slight chance your custom theme is the issue, if you have one. To know for sure, we suggest temporarily switching to one of the default WordPress themes (e.g., "Twenty Thirteen") just to see if your video does appear. If it suddenly works, then your custom theme is the issue. You can switch back when done testing.
